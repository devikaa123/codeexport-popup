# Export Code Popup (React)

This project implements a simple **popup component** for exporting code, designed to closely match the provided Figma design.  
The popup includes:
- A header with a title and a close button.
- A body with two tabs (**HTML** and **NextJS**) that render dynamic content.
- Custom checkmark and close icons using SVG.
- Styled with plain CSS.
